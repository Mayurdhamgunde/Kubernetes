# Kubernetes : - (Also called as k8s)

- Kubernetes is a container orchestration system. It provides an API for managing containers in the     cloud and beyond.

- In simlpe words Kubernetes is an open-source platform used for maintaining and deploying a group of containers.

▸ What is orchestration?
→ It's just Manage your application 
  • Deloy your application.     • Self Healing.
  • Scale it Up or Down.        • Rolling updates and rollback.

▸ Benefits of Kubernetes : - 

 > Portable and 100% open source - 
  Kubernetes is compatible across several platforms. It is 100% open source project and thus, provide greater flexibility to the users.

 > Workload Scalability - 
  Kubernetes is known to be very efficient. New servers are added and removed easily, it automatically changes the number of running containers, and it scales many containers manually. 

 > High availability - 
  Kubernetes is designed to tackle the availability of both containers and infrastructure. It is highly reliable and can be made available in any physical environment

 > Service discovery and load balancing -
  Kubernetes can expose a container using DNS or its IP address. If the traffic load is high, it balances load and distributes the network for deployment to be stable.

 > Storage orchestration - 
  Kubernetes automatically mounts storage systems like local storage and public cloud providers.

 > Self healing - 
  Kubernetes restarts container if failed, replaces containers, kill containers that don't respond to timely checks.

 > Automatic bin packing - 
  Kubernetes specifies how much CPU and RAM each container needs. Once resources are defined, managing the resources and making decision for them becomes easy.
